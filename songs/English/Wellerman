There once was a ship that put to sea
And the name of the ship was the Billy o' Tea
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
Blow, me bully boys, blow (huh!)
    
R:
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done,
We'll take our leave and go
    
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh!)
    
R:

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below (huh!)
    
R:

No line was cut, no whale was freed;
The Captain's mind was not of greed
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
She took the ship in tow (huh!)
    
R:

For forty days, or even more
The line went slack, then tight once more
All boats were lost (there were only four)
But still that whale did go

R:

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all
