1. Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try 
   No hell below us,    Above us only sky

Bridge: Imagine all the people 
        Living for today 
        
2. Imagine there's no countries , It isn't hard to do 
   Nothing to kill or die for,  And no religion too 

Bridge: Imagine all the people 
        Living life in peace 

R:  You may say I'm a dreamer 
    But I'm not the only one 
    I hope someday you'll join us 
    And the world will be as one 

3. Imagine no possessions  I wonder if you can 
   No need for greed or hunger 
   A brotherhood of men 

Bridge: Imagine all the people 
        Sharing all the world   

R.
