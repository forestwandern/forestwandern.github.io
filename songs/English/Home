[Her:]
Alabama, Arkansas,
I do love my ma and pa,
Not the way that I do love you.

[Him:]
Well, Holy, Moley, me, oh my,
You're the apple of my eye,
Girl I've never loved one like you.
    
[Her:]
Man oh man you're my best friend,
I scream it to the nothingness,
There ain't nothing that I need.
    
[Him:]
Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie,
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ,
Ain't nothing please me more than you.

R:[Both:]
Ahh Home. Let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you.
Ahh Home. Let me go ho-oh-ome.
Home is wherever I'm with you.

[Him:]
I'll follow you into the park,
Through the jungle through the dark,
Girl I never loved one like you.
    
[Her:]
Moats and boats and waterfalls,
Alley-ways and pay phone calls,
I've been everywhere with you.
    
[Him:]
That's true,
We laugh until we think we'll die,
Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
    
[Her:]
And in the streets you run afree,
Like it's only you and me,

[Both:]

Geeze, you're something to see.         
R:[Both:]
    
[Him:]
Home. Let me come home.
Home is wherever I'm with you.
    
[Her:]
Ahh home. Yes I am ho-oh-ome.
Home is when I'm alone with you.
