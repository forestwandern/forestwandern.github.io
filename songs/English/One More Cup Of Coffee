1. Your breath is sweet your eyes are like two jewels in the sky 
   your back is straight your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie 
   but I don't sense affection no gratitude or love 
   your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above. 
 
R: One more cup of coffee for the road 
   one more cup of coffee for I go to the valley below. 
 
2. Your daddy he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade 
   he'll teach you how to pick a choose and how to throw the blade 
   and he oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude 
   his voice it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.

3. Your sister sees the future like your momma and yourself 
   you've never learned to read or write there's 
   no books upon your  shelf 
   and your pleasure know no limits your voice is like a meado larks 
   but your heart is like an ocean so mysterious and dark.

R.
