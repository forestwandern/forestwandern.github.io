There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God I know I'm one   
 
My mother was a tailor 
Sewed my new blue jeans 
My father was gamblin' man 
Down in New Orleans 
 
Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is a suitcase and a trunk 
And the only time he'll be satisfied 
Is when he's all a-drunk 
 
Oh mother, tell your children 
Not to do what I have done 
Spend your lives in sin and misery 
In the house of the Rising Sun 
 
Well I've got one foot on the platform 
The other foot on the train 
I'm going back to New Orleans 
To wear that ball and chain
