Don't fool yourself,
that I hold you in my heart.
I'll never be your lover,
today, tonight, tomorrow,
I'll never give myself to you,
I'll never give my body to you.

You suffer from delusions,
denying your emotion.
You don't even realize,
that you're in love with me now.
As sure that the sun shall rise,
I know God will make you mine.

I'd rather turn myself
into a little squirrel, 
and run across high branches
to get away from you,
I'll never give myself to you,
I'll never give my body to you.

And I will get my sharp axe
from my little wood shed,
and cut down those branches
and you will fall to my arms.
As sure that the sun shall rise,
I know God will make you mine.

And I will turn myself
into the brightest star,
yes, I will shine for people,
for you I'm always too far,
I'll never give myself to you,
I'll never give my body to you.

And I will find an astrologer
to look across the night sky,
and when I find that bright star,
I know you will wonder why.
As sure that the sun shall rise,
I know God will make you mine.
As sure that the sun shall rise,
I know God will make you mine.
