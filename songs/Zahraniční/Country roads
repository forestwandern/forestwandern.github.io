Almost heaven, West Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah river.
Life is old there, older than the trees,
younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze.

Dark and dusty, painted in the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye.

the radio reminds me off my home far away.

yesterday.
