I'm so young and you're so old, 
this, my darling, I've been told. 
I don't care just what they say, 
cause forever I will pray. 
You and I will be as free, 
as the birds up in the trees. 
Ooooooh, pleeeeease, stay by me, Diana. 
 
Thrills I get when you hold me close, 
oh, my darling, you're the most. 
I love you but do you love me? 
Oh, Diana, can't you see? 
I love you with all my heart, 
and I hope we will never part. 
Ooooh, pleeeeeease, stay by me, Diana. 
 
Oh, my darlin', oh, my lover, 
tell me that there is no other. 
I love you, with my heart.. 
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh... 
Only you can take my heart, 
only you can tear it apart. 
When you hold me in your loving arms, 
I can feel you giving all your charms. 
Hold me, darling, ho..ho..hold me tight, 
squeeze me baby with-a all your might. 
Ooooh, pleeeease, stay by me, Diana.
